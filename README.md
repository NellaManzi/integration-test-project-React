# Why is this so important

TBD - The testing world is moving from pyramids to diamonds, more emphasis is being put on integration tests and for good reasons. Here to put reasons to move toward more integration tests

<br/><br/><br/>

# What can you find here?

This repo provides the following benefits and assets:

**1. 📊  Example application -** A Complete showcase of a typical Microservice with tests setup and the test themselves

**2. ✅ 40+ Best Practices List -** Detailed instructions on how to write integartiong tests in the RIGHT way including code example and reference to the example application

**3. 🚀   Advanced stuff -** How to take this technique to the next level and maximize your invest. This includes beyond the basics techniques like store your DB data in a fast RAM folder, detect memory leaks during tests, testing data migrations, contract tests and more

<br/><br/><br/>

# 📊 Example application

In this folder you may find a complete example of real-world like application, a tiny Orders component (e.g. e-commerce ordering), including tests. We recommend skimming through this examples before or during reading the best practices. Note that we intentionally kept the app small enough to ease the reader experience. On top of it, a 'various-recipes' folder exists with additional patterns and practices - This is your next step in the learning journey

# ✅ Best Practices

<br/>

## **Section: Web server setup**

<br/>

### ⚪️ 1. The test and the backend should live within the same process

🏷&nbsp; **Tags:** `#basic, #strategic`

:white_check_mark: &nbsp; **Do:** The tests should start the webserver within the same process, not in a remote environment or container. Failing to do so will result in lose of critical features: A test won't be able to simulate various important events using test doubles (e.g. make some component throw an exception), customize environment variables, and make configuration changes. Also, the complexity of measuring code coverage and intercepting network calls will highly increase

<br/>

👀 &nbsp; **Alternatives:** one might spin the backend in Docker container or just a separate Node process. This configuration better resembles the production but it will lack critical testing features as mentioned above ❌; Some teams run integration tests against production-like cloud envrionment (see bullet 'Reuse tests against production-like environment), this is a valid technique for extra validation but will get too slow and limiting to rely on during develoment ❌; 

<br/>

<details><summary>✏ <b>Code Examples</b></summary>

```
const apiUnderTest = require('../api/start.js');

beforeAll(async (done) => {
  //Start the backend in the same process
```

)
  

</details>

<br/><br/>

### ⚪️ 2. Let the tests control when the server should start and shutoff

🏷&nbsp; **Tags:** `#basic, #strategic`

:white_check_mark: &nbsp; **Do:** The server under test should let the test decide when to open the connection and when to close it. If the webserver do this alone automatically when its file is imported, then the test has no chance to perform important actions beforehand (e.g. change DB connection string). It also won't stand a chance to close the connection and avoid hanging resources. Consequently, the web server initialize code should expose two functions: start(port), stop(). By doing so, the production code has the initializtion logic and the test should control the timing

<br/>

👀 &nbsp; **Alternatives:** The web server initializtion code might return a reference to the webserver (e.g. Express app) so the tests open the connection and control it - This will require to put another identical production code that opens connections, then tests and production code will deviate a bit ❌; Alternativelly, one can avoid closing connections and wait for the process to exit - This might leave hanging resources and won't solve the need to do some actions before startup ❌

<br/>

<details><summary>✏ <b>Code Examples</b></summary>

```
const initializeWebServer = async (customMiddleware) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // A typical Express setup
    expressApp = express();
    defineRoutes(expressApp);
    connection = expressApp.listen(() => {
      resolve(expressApp);
    });
  });
}

const stopWebServer = async () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    connection.close(() => {
      resolve();
    })
  });
}

beforeAll(async (done) => {
  expressApp = await initializeWebServer();
  done();
  }

afterAll(async (done) => {
  await stopWebServer();
  done();
});


```

)
  

</details>

<br/><br/>

### ⚪️ 3. Specify a port in production, randomize in testing

🏷&nbsp; **Tags:** `#intermediate`

:white_check_mark: &nbsp; **Do:** Let the server randomize a port in testing to prevent port collisions. Otherwise, specifying a specific port will prevent two testing processes from running at the same time. Almost every network object (e.g. Node.js http server, TCP, Nest, etc) randmoizes a port by default when no specific port is specified

<br/>

👀 &nbsp; **Alternatives:** Running a single process will slow down the tests ❌; Some parallelize the tests but instantiate a single web server, in this case the tests live in a different process and will lose many features like test doubles (see dedicated bullet above) ❌; 

<br/>


<details><summary>✏ <b>Code Examples</b></summary>

```
// api-under-test.js
const initializeWebServer = async (customMiddleware) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // A typical Express setup
    expressApp = express();
    connection = expressApp.listen(webServerPort, () => {// No port
      resolve(expressApp);
    });
  });
};

// test.js
beforeAll(async (done) => {
  expressApp = await initializeWebServer();//No port
  });

### ⚪️ 4. One more thing here

🏷&nbsp; **Tags:** `#intermediate, #draft`

</details>

<br/><br/>


## **Section: Database setup**

<br/>

### ⚪️ 1. Use Docker-Compose to host the database and other infrastructure

🏷&nbsp; **Tags:** `#strategic`

:white_check_mark: &nbsp; **Do:** All the databases, message queues and infrastructure that is being used by the app should run in a docker-compose environment for testing purposes. Only this technology check all these boxes: A mature and popular technology that can't be reused among developer machines and CI. One setup, same files, run everywhere. Sweet value but one remarkable caveat - It's different from the production runtime platform. Things like memory limits, deployment pipeline, graceful shutdown and a-like act differently in other environments - Make sure to test those using pre-production tests over the real environment. Note that the app under test should not neccesserily be part of this docker-compose and can keep on running locally - This is usually more comfortable for developers


<br/>

👀 &nbsp; **Alternatives:** A popular option is manual installation of local database - This results in developers working hard to get in-sync with each other ("Did you set the right permissions in the DB?") and configuring a different setup in CI ❌; Some use local Kuberentes or Serverless emulators which act almost like the real-thing, sounds promising but it won't work over most CIs vendors and usually more complex to setup in developers machine❌;  

<br/>

<details><summary>✏ <b>Code Examples</b></summary>
//docker-compose file
```
version: "3.6"
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:11
    command: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=myuser
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=myuserpassword
      - POSTGRES_DB=shop
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

➡️ [Full code here](https://github.com/testjavascript/nodejs-integration-tests-best-practices/blob/fb93b498d437aa6d0469485e648e74a6b9e719cc/example-application/test/docker-compose.yml#L1
)
  

</details>

<br/><br/>

### ⚪️ 2. Start docker-compose using code in the global setup process

🏷&nbsp; **Tags:** `#strategic, #draft`

:white_check_mark:  **Do:** In a typical multi-process test runner (e.g. Mocha, Jest), the infrastructure should be started in a global setup/hook ([Jest global setup](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#globalsetup-string)), [Mocha global fixture](https://mochajs.org/#global-setup-fixtures)  using custom code that spin up the docker-compose file. This takes away common workflows pains - The DB is an explicit dependency of the test, no more tests failing because the DB is down. A new developer onboarded? Get him up to speed with nothing more than ```git clone && npm test```. Everything happens automatically, no tedious README.md, no developers wonder what setup steps did they miss. In addition, going with this approach maximizes the test performance: the DB is not instantiated per process or per file, rather once and only once. On the global teardown phase, all the containers should shutoff (See a dedicated bullet below) 

<br/>


👀 &nbsp; **Alternatives:** A popular option is manual installation of local database - This results in developers working hard to get in-sync with each other ("Did you set the right permissions in the DB?") and configuring a different setup in CI ❌; Some use local Kuberentes or Serverless emulators which act almost like the real-thing, sounds promising but it won't work over most CIs vendors and usually more complex to setup in developers machine❌;

)
  

</details>

<br/><br/>


### ⚪️ 3. Shutoff the infrastructure only in the CI environment

🏷&nbsp; **Tags:** `#performance, #draft`

:white_check_mark:  **Do:** On the performance gain while keeping up in dev environment, what about cleaning data (other bullet), show numbers, an emotional sentence why it's so fun to get feedback while writing. CI is the same, just cold start

<br/>


👀 &nbsp; **Alternatives:** Re-start anytime ❌;

)
  

</details>

<br/><br/>

### ⚪️ 4. Optimize your real DB for testing, Don't fake it

🏷&nbsp; **Tags:** `#performance, #draft`

:white_check_mark:  **Do:** Avoid fake DBs, it brings noise, loosen the DB durability settings to gain performance boost, for example {something}, show numbers,


<br/>


👀 &nbsp; **Alternatives:** Use SQLite which is actually slower ❌;  no optimizations

)
  

</details>

<br/><br/>

### ⚪️ 5. Store test data in RAM folder

🏷&nbsp; **Tags:** `#performance, #draft`

:white_check_mark:  **Do:** Minor boost, harder in Mac, easier in Linux using tmpfs, some DB has a built-in memory engine which you may consider because

)
  

</details>

<br/><br/>

### ⚪️ 6. Build the DB schema using migrations

🏷&nbsp; **Tags:** `#performance, #draft`

:white_check_mark:  **Do:** Minor boost, harder in Mac, easier in Linux using tmpfs, some DB has a built-in memory engine which you may consider because

)
  

</details>

<br/><br/>

### ⚪️ 8. Isolate the component from the world using HTTP interceptor

:white_check_mark:  **Do:**
Intercept all calls to extraneous services and provide a default sensible result. Use the library nock for this matter. Consider raising an exception anytime an unknown HTTP call was made. If a specific request affects the test result, the interception of this call must be defined within the test so the reader will be able to easily grasp the cause and effect

<br/><br/>

## **Section: Database and infrastructure setup**

<br/>

### ⚪️ 1. Place a start and stop method within your app entry point

:white_check_mark: **Do:**
For proper startup and teardown, the app entry point (e.g. webserver start code) must expose for the testing a start and stop methods that will initialize and teardown all resources. The tests will use these methods to initialize the app (e.g. API, MQ) and clean-up when done

<br/>

👀 **Alternatives:**
The application under test can avoid opening connections and delegate this to the test, however this will make a change between production and test code. Alternativelly, one can just let the test runner kill the resources then with frequent testing many connections will leak and might choke the machine

<br/>

<details><summary>✏ <b>Code Examples</b></summary>

```
const initializeWebServer = async (customMiddleware) => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // A typical Express setup
    expressApp = express();
    defineRoutes(expressApp);
    connection = expressApp.listen(() => {
      resolve(expressApp);
    });
  });
}

      resolve();
    })
  });
